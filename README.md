 ## Projects

Here are a few of my favorite projects:

### 1. [React Components](https://github.com/DevAmo001/react-component)
This project marks my first journey into React development, focusing on understanding and building with React components. My aim is to set up a clean, well-organized environment that leverages React's component-based architecture for efficient and dynamic UI creation.
### 2. [Netlix-Website-clone](https://github.com/DevAmo001/Netflix-website-clone)
This project is a "Netflix-inspired website" built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It aims to replicate the core design and user interface of Netflix, offering a smooth and visually appealing experience.While still in development, the clone will feature dynamic content display and responsive design, enhancing both usability and aesthetics.
### 3.[To-do List](https://github.com/DevAmo001/To-Do-List)
A simple To-Do List web app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to add tasks, set specific due dates for each task, and manage their tasks effectively.
### 4.[Rock Paper Scissor](https://github.com/DevAmo001/Rock-Paper-Scissor-Game)
